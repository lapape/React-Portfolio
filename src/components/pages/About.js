        My name is Lacey Pape and I am a current full stack web development
        bootcamp student at the Denver University. Before the bootcamp, I had no
        experience with coding but was always interested in computers and how
        they work. I have thoroughly enjoyed learning how to code, and I am very
        excited to join the industry and broaden my knowledge base even further!
        The bootcamp has covered many libraries and languages inclduing: HTML,
        CSS, Javascript, Nodejs, SQL, MongoDB, express, and react.
